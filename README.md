# Acrcade Light Game


## A light pattern game, that gets increasingly more difficult as you beat each level. 
In order to progress, the left button must be hit when the 10th LED is lit. This must happen while the A1 pin is being held. If this is not completed a midi tone will beep a few times and the words "You lose, here was your score:" will be displayed in the serial monitor.The score will be dsiplayed aswell. If the level is progressed, the score will go up, and a nice few tones will play. The speed of the LED's ligthing up will increase aswell. This same process will be done over and over again for a total of 4 levels.
